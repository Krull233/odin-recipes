<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Sauté the mushrooms:</strong> Place mushrooms in a large (6 to 8
    quart) sauté pan on high or medium-high heat. Stir them with a wooden spoon
    or shake the pan from time to time. You may hear them squeak. Sprinkle salt
    over the mushrooms. The mushrooms will sizzle and then start to release
    water. (Note that you are not adding fat at this point to the pan; this
    method of cooking mushrooms in their own moisture is called "dry sautéing.)
    Once the mushrooms start to release water into the pan, stir in the chopped
    onions. Cook until the mushrooms are no longer releasing moisture and the
    mushroom water has boiled away, about 5 minutes more.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Add the olive oil to the mushrooms and stir
    to coat. Sauté the mushrooms and onions for about a minute. Add the garlic
    and cook for another minute. Stir in the tomato paste, cook for a minute
    longer. Reserve 1 cup of the tomato sauce (it will go in the bottom of the
    casserole dish), and put the remaining cup of tomato sauce into the pot with
    the mushrooms. Add the large can of crushed tomatoes and one cup of water.
    Stir in the thyme, sugar, and red pepper flakes. (If you are using dried
    basil instead of fresh, add it now.) Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat
    and simmer on a low simmer, for 20 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles:</strong> Once the sauce is
    simmering, salt the boiling pasta water, and add the dry lasagna noodles to
    the boiling water. (The water should be at a vigorous, rolling boil.) Stir
    gently, making sure that the noodles are not sticking to each other. Set the
    timer for 8 minutes, or however long is indicated on the package of the
    noodles. Cook uncovered on a high boil. When the noodles are ready (al
    dente, cooked through but still firm to the bite), drain the noodles in a
    colander, and rinse them to cool them with cold water. As you rinse them,
    gently separate them with your fingers so they don't stick to each other.
    Prepare a couple large cookie sheets or baking sheets by spreading a
    tablespoon of olive oil over the baking sheets. Place the lasagna noodles on
    the sheets, gently coating them with a bit of that olive oil, and spreading
    them out. This will help keep them from sticking to each other while you
    finish the sauce and prepare the layered casserole.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong> Turn off the heat on the stovetop for
    the sauce. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spread the one cup of reserved tomato
    sauce over the bottom of a large (preferably 10x15-inch) casserole dish. (If
    your casserole dish is smaller, you may need to add another layer as you go
    through this step.) Place a layer of lasagna noodles down over the tomato
    sauce, slightly overlapping. (For our 10x15-inch dish, we ultimately fit 3
    layers of 6 noodles each, with 2 extra noodles on which to nosh.) Sprinkle
    half of the ricotta cheese over the noodles, and half of the defrosted,
    drained, and squeezed out spinach over the ricotta. Sprinkle half of the
    mozzarella cheese over the spinach, and just a quarter of the pecorino
    cheese. Then spoon 1/3 of your mushroom sauce over the mozzarella. Sprinkle
    half of the fresh basil over the sauce.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Repeat the layers:</strong> Repeat the layering process. Place a
    second layer of noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining ricotta,
    spinach, and mozzarella over the noodles. Sprinkle another quarter of the
    pecorino along with the mozzarella. Top with another third of the mushroom
    sauce and the remaining fresh basil. Layer your final layer of lasagna
    noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining sauce over the lasagna noodles,
    and sprinkle with the remaining pecorino or parmesan cheese.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cover with foil and bake:</strong> Pull out a sheet of aluminum foil
    large enough to cover the casserole dish. Spread a little olive oil over the
    inside of the piece of foil (the side that will have contact with the
    lasagna). Place the foil over the casserole dish and crimp the edges. Bake
    at 350°F for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake uncovered for an
    additional 25 minutes. Take the lasagna out of the oven when done and let it
    rest 10 minutes before cutting to serve. Once made, the lasagna will last a
    week in the fridge.
